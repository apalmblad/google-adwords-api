This project hosts the new Ads common framework for Ruby, as well as the Ruby client libraries for the various SOAP-based Ads APIs at Google.

The Ruby client libraries make it easier to write Ruby clients to programmatically access your accounts.

h1. Client Library Features
* Support for logging incoming and outgoing SOAP messages
* Support for logging request information
* Support for API calls to the production or Sandbox environments
* Local validation for parameter number and type on API calls
* Thread-safe
* Ruby-like syntax, by converting all method names and properties to snake_case instead of camelCase
* Simplified development model by using arrays and hashes instead of soap4r objects (will also allow us to move away from soap4r in the future)
* (AdWords) Support for tracking API unit usage
* (AdWords) Report downloading in XML and CSV formats

*Note*: These client libraries do not fully support SSL validation at the moment.
